I want you to create a simple html/javascript game - no React JS
This game is called Cowboys 
It is 2d top down 
Two players attempt to shoot each other 
Each Player can take 3 hits
In the way are Cacti that can ricochet the bullets
The bullets travel very fast
Player 1 - uses wasd - c to fire
Player 2 uses ijkl - n to fire
